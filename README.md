# grind

Helps you track your grind! :muscle:

List out your grind daily in the local environment via CLI. Data storage relies on local files (json and csv files), thus doesn't need any internet connection (can be run on an env without any internet connectivity).

## Installation

Currently we support installation from source. Other type of installation might be supported in the future.

### From source

1. Make sure you have Golang in your local workspace (1.21+), or [download it here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

2. Make sure to update your `$PATH` to include your `$GOBIN`.

3. Run `make install`.

4. Let's go `grind`-ing! :muscle:

## Introduction

We all have at least one activity (or more), which may become a routine already. Some of them might be important for our personal life goal and growth (which we might not aware). Maybe it's not about personal goal, maybe it's about business goal, or any other goals you want to pursue. But on the other side, we have a very limited time. That's why we need to focus! :dart:

`grind` helps you to track down your daily, weekly, or even monthly grind activities. It's pretty similar with to-do list apps out there, but the difference is that `grind` is mainly focusing for your recurring activities (or routine, you say).

## How to use

You can follow these simplified guide:

1. Download and install `grind` to your local workspace.

2. Prepare your grind activities. You can check out the `template.csv` file as a starting point (by renaming it to `grind.csv` to make it work).

3. Run the `grind` at least once daily. Try to complete all the listed items there! :100:
